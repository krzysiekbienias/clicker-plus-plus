# 🧟‍♂️ Clicker++
> *Every algorithm has a story. Every bug has a bite. Every ++ is a step closer to mastery.*

Welcome to **Clicker++**, a C++ algorithms survival kit forged in the chaos of complexity.

This project is more than a collection of algorithms—it's a **modular journey** through data structures, recursion, dynamic programming, and legendary algorithmic challenges. Each folder is a **safehouse**, each test a battle against the darkness of bugs, and each implementation a step toward surviving the code apocalypse.

Whether you're just beginning your trek through the algorithm wastelands or preparing for a boss-level technical interview, **Clicker++** is your crafted companion.

## Project Structure

- header/ – Headers for each algorithm, utility, or data structure

- src/ – Corresponding C++ implementation files

- unit\_tests/ – Google Test-based tests, grouped by topic

- CMakeLists.txt – Modular build system via CMake

## 🚀 Getting Started
#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/clicker-plus-plus.git
cd clicker-plus-plus
```
#### 2. Build the project 
Run the setup script to configure and compile everything:
```bash
./rebuild.sh
```
 > This will generate and build the project using CMake inside xcode\_build/ or another designated build folder.
#### 3. Run unit tests
Once build ,solve your problem add unit tests and done. Have fun!!
> [!NOTE]
> Please note that if you are using Xcode change schema on test environment or use terminal.
